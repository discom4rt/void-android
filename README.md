## Description

Void is an experimental media sharing platform in which all content is anonymized and ownership is determined randomly.  Each media item is tagged only with the location of its creation. For each one that you send into the void, you will receive a random one from a different user.  Your "stream" is ultimately made up of content from other users.

## Development
**[check out the development journal](https://github.com/discom4rt/void-android/blob/master/JOURNAL.md)**

This is my first Android app initially developed during a 6 week Android development course at [Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/).  The course is designed to give students an opportunity to learn Android development while simultaneously encouraging them to explore unique interaction types.

## Server

Void is supported by [this server applicaiton](https://github.com/discom4rt/void-server).
